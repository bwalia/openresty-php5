					<h2>Domestic Staff Agency - Introduction</h2>
					<p>Marshall Harber&#39;s consultants are trained professionals and we are more than happy to advise and provide you with as much information as possible that will allow you to make the right choice. Until a placement has been confirmed, all our services are free of charge.</p>
					<h2>Domestic Staff - Suitability of Candidates</h2>
					<p>Our candidates&#39; work history and suitability is thoroughly researched and we endeavour to only submit details on candidates that have the necessary experience, capabilities and character for the position offered by our clients. Our candidates are all invited to interview with our consultants and we will advise our candidates to obtain a CRB check if they have not already applied for one.</p>
					<h2>Domestic Staff - Database</h2>
					<p>We have an extensive database that allows us to select only those candidates most appropriate for the position. CVs will not be put forward unless our consultants are confident that they meet our clients&#39; requirements. Our live database of candidates can also be viewed and contacted using our new &quot;Online Service&quot; <a href="http://www.householdstaffonline.com" target="_blank">at www.householdstaffonline.com</a></p>
					<h2>Domestic Staff - Home Visits</h2>
					<p>If you would prefer a more personal and discreet consultation regarding your full staffing requirements, one of our consultants would be happy to visit your home to make a complete assessment of your situation. This service is only offered where sole agency has been granted to MH. Overseas visits are also possible by special arrangement.</p>
					<h2>Domestic Staff - Advice</h2>
					<p>Marshall Harber&#39;s consultants are here to advise you on any aspect of the recruitment procedure. We can provide you with information on Tax and National Insurance issues, contracts, security and interview procedures.</p>
					<h2>Domestic Staff - Service Guarantee</h2>
					<p>We offer a  three-month replacement guarantee on all permanent placements, excluding yacht crew, subject to our Terms and Conditions of Business. Our aim is to build a committed relationship with our clients that results in a lasting relationship with their staff.</p>
					<h2>Domestic Staff - Confirmation and Payment</h2>
					<p>Once a placement has been confirmed an invoice will be issued and must be settled within seven days of date of issue. This must be strictly adhered to for our replacement guarantee to apply.</p>
					<h2>Domestic Staff - Post Placement Policy</h2>
					<p>Marshall Harber&#39;s responsibility to our clients does not end once a placement has been made. It is our policy to follow up on our candidate&#39;s progress and we are always available to discuss any issues, should the need arise.</p>
					<p>For further information on any of our domestic staff services, or if you have any enquiries relating to an existing arrangement, please do not hesitate to <a href="contact.asp"><img src="images/text/contactUs.gif" alt="Contact Us" width="65" height="13" /></a>.</p>
